**Current Status:**
- The project frontend is now hosted on Firebase Hosting and the backend Cloud Functions are deployed on Cloud Run.
- We successfully addressed critical deployment issues, including fixing firebase.json syntax, resolving a backend module loading error, correcting frontend import problems, and deploying both functions and hosting.
- The application should now be accessible and functional via the Firebase Hosting URL (https://link-in-bio-hub.web.app).

**Next Steps: Making the Frontend Production-Ready:**

1.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire application via the Firebase Hosting URL.

2. **Paid Feature Integration:** Plan for integrating premium features. The AI Chatbot Training (allowing users to train the chatbot with custom knowledge) is a prime candidate for a paid feature. This requires implementing access control on both the frontend and backend, and integrating a subscription/payment mechanism.

3.  **UI/UX Refinement and Polishing:** Focus on making the user interface intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and highly usable.

    - **Frontend Testing:** Test all UI components, user flows (login, registration, editing profile/links, using AI features, etc.), responsiveness on different devices, and cross-browser compatibility.
    - **Integration Testing:** Verify that the frontend correctly interacts with the backend API endpoints (sending requests, handling responses, error handling).

2.  **UI/UX Refinement and Polishing:** Focus on making the user interface intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and highly usable.
    - **Design Review:** Evaluate the overall visual design, color palettes, typography, and spacing. Ensure consistency.
    - **Responsiveness:** Rigoureus testen op verschillende schermformaten (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure a seamless experience.
    - **Accessibility:** Check for accessibility standards (e.g., sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).
    - **User Flow Optimization:** Analyze how users navigate the app and identify any friction points. Simplify complex interactions.
    - **Loading States and Feedback:** Ensure clear loading indicators and user feedback for asynchronous operations (API calls, AI generation).
    - **Error Handling in UI:** Display user-friendly error messages instead of technical details when backend calls fail.

3.  **Performance Optimization:** Ensure the frontend loads quickly and runs smoothly.
    - **Code Splitting:** Implement code splitting to reduce initial load time.
    - **Image Optimization:** Optimize images for web use.
    - **Asset Compression:** Verify that assets are served compressed.

4.  **Code Quality and Maintainability:**
    - **Review Code:** Refactor any complex or redundant code sections.
    - **Add Comments:** Add comments where necessary to clarify complex logic.
    - **Ensure Type Safety:** Leverage TypeScript effectively.

5.  **Prepare for Launch:**
    - **Review all text content:** Ensure clarity and correct grammar.
    - **Final configuration checks:** Verify all environment variables and Firebase settings.

This focused approach will help ensure the frontend provides a polished and reliable experience for users before wider publication.
